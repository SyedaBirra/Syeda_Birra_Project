---

**Overview:**
This is a Python implementation of a simple Bloom filter, a data structure used to check if an item is part of a set. Bloom filters are probabilistic, meaning they may produce false positives but never false negatives.

**Contents:**
* Bloom_filter.py:
It contains 'BloomFilter' class with functions to add and check whether an item contains in the set. It also includes example and basic tests to verify that the Bloom Filter works as expected.
* README.md: This file contains the contents of the repository as well as a summary of the conclusions.
